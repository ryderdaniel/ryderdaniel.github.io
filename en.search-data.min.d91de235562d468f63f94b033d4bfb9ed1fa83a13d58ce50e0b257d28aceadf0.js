However they are useful in different situations. Verbal is useful for communicating between people List, Table or vector is useful for representation and processing within a computer Sum of unit step functions is useful for analyzing mathematically what happens to the waveform when it passes through a communication channel.  Functions to Specify Waveforms   Graphs are intuitve ways to specify waveforms.\n  But to do analysis, we need to use formulas that give the value of the waveform $x$ for any sample $n$.\n  One possibility\n  \\[x(n) = \\begin{cases} 1 \u0026amp; 0 \\leq n \u0026lt; 4 \\\\ 0 \u0026amp; 4 \\leq n \u0026lt; 8 \\\\ \\vdots \u0026amp; \\vdots \\\\ b_k \u0026amp; k \\cdot \\text{SPB} \\leq n \u0026lt; (k \u0026#43; 1) \\cdot \\text{SPB} \\\\ \\vdots \u0026amp; \\vdots \\end{cases}\\]    However it is difficult to work with this formula. We seek a better way using the unit step function.\n  Unit Step Function  In order to get a better formula to define a bit waveform, we define the unit step function $u(n)$\n \\[u(n) = \\begin{cases} 0 \u0026amp; n \u0026lt; 0 \\\\ 1 \u0026amp; 0 \\leq n \\end{cases}\\]    We can delay the step function as follows:\n \\[u(n-d) = \\begin{cases} 0 \u0026amp; n \u0026lt; d \\\\ 1 \u0026amp; d \\leq n \\end{cases}\\]  Combining Step Functions  We can describe a single pulse as the difference between two step functions.\n  Representing Bit Waveforms  We can describe any bit sequence as the sum and difference of unit step functions One step function every time a bit changes  If the bit changes from 0 to 1 at sample $D$, add $u(n-D)$ If the bit changes from 1 to 0 at sample $D$, subtract $u(n-D)$ If there is no change, add nothing.    The Discrete Time Channel Communication System  Transmitter encodes information as a physical waveform. The physical waveform travels over a medium (e.g. air) which modifies the waveform as it passes. This medium is called the channel. The reciever must take this modified waveform and try to figure out the original information.\n  Discrete Time Channel  Modern communication systems are built from computers that work in discrete time, but most channels are in continuous time.

The shorter the bit time, the faster we can transmit information (bits).  Encoding information with Bits Bits  A bit is the basic unit of information used in modern computers and communication systems. A bit is a variable that can assume one of two values or \u0026ldquo;states\u0026rdquo;. Commonly denoted as $0$ or $1$. Can be thought of as the answer to a yes/no question. Variables that can assume more than two values can still be represented by conbinations or sequences of bits. Example:  binary numbers ASCII    Sequence of Yes/No Questions A binary number can also be thought of as the answer to a series of yes/no (1/0) questions. For example if $N=3$,\n Binary Digits  We can use N bits $b_{N-1}, b_{N-2}, \u0026hellip;, b_1, b_0$ to represents integers from $0$ to $2^N -1$. Each digit is the sum of powers of two  $$x = \\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} 2^i \\cdot b_i$$\n Notation:  $b_{N-1}$ is the most significant bit (MSB). $b_0$ is the least significant bit (LSB).    ASCII Codes  ASCII = American Standard Code for Information Interchange An 8-bit code used to represent text symbols.   See this\nBit Sequences  Information we want to send is typically encoded as long bit sequences created by concatenating binary code words.  Continuous vs Discrete Time Waveforms  A continuous time (CT) signal has a known value for all points in a time interval. A discrete time (DT) signal has a known value only at a discrete (discontinuous) set of time points.  Sampling: From Continuous to Discrete  We can obtain discrete time waveforms by sampling (recording) a continuous time waveform $x_c(t)$ at regular intervals in time.  $T_s$ = Sample Period   We typically index (identify, label) each sample by an integer sample number, $n$. We denote the sampled waveform by $x(n)$ The $n$th corresponds to the waveform at the time $t = nT_s$. i.e. $x(n) = x_c(nT_s)$  From Discrete to Continuous Time  Given samples $x(n)$, we can obtain a continuous time waveform $x_h(t)$ by holding the waveform at $x(n)$ between times $nT_s$ and $(n+1)T_s$  Sampling Period vs Frequency  $T_s$ = Sample Period (time interval between samples)  Typical unit: Seconds (s)   $F_s$ = Sampling frequency (number of samples in a fixed period of time)  Typical unit: Hertz (Hz samples per second)   Relation: $$F_s = \\frac{1}{T_s}$$  Example:\n$T_s = 0.2$ seconds\n$F_s = \\frac{1 \\text{ sample}}{0.2 \\text{ seconds}} = 5 Hz$\nNumber of Samples   If we sample a signal at intervals of $T_s$ over a finite time window $T_w$, we obtain $N$ samples where\n$$N = \\frac{T_w}{T_s} = T_w \\cdot F_s$$\n  This is an example of an engineering tradeoff: A higher sample frequency is:\n Good: Less information lost since less time between samples Bad: More storage is needed since more samples for a given length of time.

Members and Elements  The objects that make up a set are called members or elements of the set. An object is anything that is \u0026ldquo;meaningful\u0026rdquo;. For example: a number, equation, other sets, etc\u0026hellip;  Equality of Sets  Two sets are equal if and only if they have the same members. That is, a set is completely determined by its members. This is the principle of extension.  Set Notation A set can be described by listing comma seperated members within curly braces\nExample:\nLet $S = \\{1,3,9\\}$\n$S$ is a set, and $1,3,9$ are its members.\n It is important to note that order and repetition do not matter in sets. That is, $\\{1,3,9\\}$ is equivalent to $\\{9,1,3\\}$ and $\\{1,1,1,1,9,9,9,9,3,9,3\\}$. They all denote a set whose members are $1, 3, \\text{and} \\space 9$.\nThe Membership Symbol $\\in$  The fact that $x$ is a member of $S$ can be expressed as $x \\in S$. The membership symbol $\\in$ can be read as \u0026ldquo;is in\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;is a member of\u0026rdquo;, or \u0026ldquo;belongs to\u0026rdquo;. The negation of $\\in$ is $\\not\\in$  Example:\nLet $S = \\{7,13,21,47\\}$, then $7 \\in S, 13 \\in S, 21 \\in S, 47 \\in S, 56 \\not\\in S$.\nDefining a Set by Membership Properties $$S = \\{x \\in T \\space| \\space P(x)\\}$$ The members of $S$ are members of an already known set $T$ that satisfy property $P$.  Example:\n Let $\\Bbb Z$ be the set of integers. Let $\\Bbb Z_+$ be the set of positive integers. Then $\\Bbb Z_+ = \\{x \\in \\Bbb Z \\space | \\space x \u0026gt; 0\\}$  The Empty Set and Sets of Numbers The Empty Set  The empty set is also called the null set. It is a set with no members.

To prove and equality, we prove two subset relationships.\nExample Showing the Equality of Sets:\n Recall that $\\Bbb Z$ is the set of all integers. Let $A = \\{x \\in \\Bbb Z \\space | \\space x = 2m \\space \\text{for some } m \\in \\Bbb Z \\}$ Let $B = \\{y \\in \\Bbb Z \\space | \\space y = 2n-2 \\space \\text{for some } n \\in \\Bbb Z\\}$ To show that $A \\subseteq B$, note that  $2m = 2(m+1)-2 = 2n-2$   To show that $B \\subseteq A$, note that  $2n-2 = 2(n-1) = 2m$   That is, $A=B$ Both $A$ and $B$ denote the set of even integers.  Exercise:\n Let  $A = \\{x \\in \\Bbb Z \\space | \\space x^2 -1 = 0\\}$ $B = \\{x \\in \\Bbb Z \\space | \\space 2x^3 - x^2 -2x +1 = 0\\}$    Show that $A = B$ by the method of mutual inclusion.\n Potential Answer ↕   To show that $A \\subseteq B$:  $x^2 -1 = 0 \\implies x = \\pm 1$ $\\because x = \\pm 1, \\space x^3 = x$ $\\forall n \\in \\Bbb R, \\space n - n = 0$ $\\text{From (2) and (3), } \\space x^2-1=0 \\implies -(x^2-1) + (2x^3-2x) = 0$ $\\therefore x^2-1 = 0 \\implies 2x^3-x^2-2x+1=0$   To show that $B \\subseteq A$:  $2x^3-x^2-2x+1=0$ $2x(x^2-1)-(x^2-1)=0$ $(2x-1)(x^2-1)=0$ $\\because x \\in \\Bbb Z, \\space (2x-1)(x^2-1) = 0 \\implies (x^2-1) = 0$    $\\therefore A = B$    Universal Sets, Venn Diagrams Universal Sets  Depending on the context of discussion:  Define a set $\\Bbb U$ such that all sets of interest are subsets of $\\Bbb U$. The set $\\Bbb U$ is known as a universal set.     Example:\n When dealing with integers, $\\Bbb U$ may be $\\Bbb Z$. When dealing with plane geometry, $\\Bbb U$ may be the set of all points in the plane.  Venn Diagrams  Used to visualize relationships among some sets Each subset of $\\Bbb U$ is represented by a circle/oval inside of a rectangle.   Set Operations Let $A, B$ be subsets of some universal set $\\Bbb U$.\nThe following set operations create new sets from $A$ and $B$:\n Union  $A \\cup B = \\{x \\in \\Bbb U \\space | \\space x \\in A \\text{ or } x \\in B\\}$ Example: $$\\{1,2,3\\} \\cup \\{2,3,4,5\\} = \\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$$   Intersection  $A \\cap B = \\{x \\in \\Bbb U \\space | \\space x \\in A \\text{ and } x \\in B\\}$ Example: $$\\{1,2,3\\} \\cap \\{2,3,4,5\\} = \\{2,3\\}$$   Difference  $A - B = A \\backslash B = \\{x \\in \\Bbb U \\space | \\space x \\in A \\text{ and } x \\not \\in B\\}$ Example: $$\\{1,2,3\\} - \\{2,3,4,5\\} = \\{1\\}$$   Complement  $A^c = \\Bbb U - A = \\{x \\in \\Bbb U \\space | \\space x \\not \\in A\\}$    Venn Diagram Visualization Union  Intersection  Difference  Complement   Set Identities  Commutative Laws:  $A \\cup B = B \\cup A$ $A \\cap B = B \\cap A$   Associative Laws:  $(A \\cup B) \\cup C = A \\cup (B \\cup C)$ $(A \\cap B) \\cap C = A \\cap (B \\cap C)$   Distributive Laws:  $A \\cup (B \\cap C) = (A \\cup B) \\cap (A \\cup C)$ $A \\cap (B \\cup C) = (A \\cap B) \\cup (A \\cap C)$   $\\emptyset$ is the identity for union:  $\\emptyset \\cup A = A \\cup \\emptyset = A$   $\\Bbb U$ is the identitiy for intersection:  $A \\cap \\Bbb U = \\Bbb U \\cap A = A$   Double Complement Law:  $(A^c)^c = A$   Idempotent Laws:  $A \\cup A = A$ $A \\cap A = A$   De Morgan\u0026rsquo;s Laws:  $(A \\cup B)^c = A^c \\cap B^c$ $(A \\cap B)^c = A^c \\cup B^c$    Questions  What is $(A \\cap B) \\cap (A \\cup B)$?

Effectively associating or relating one value to another.\nGeneral Functions Since a function relates one value to another, we can think of a function as relating one object to another object. These objects dont necessarily need to be numbers.\nUsually, we want to be able to relate each object of interest to only one object. That is, a function is a single-valued and exhaustive relation.\n A relation $f$ from $A$ to $B$ is a function from $A$ to $B$ if and only if:  For every $x \\in A$, there exists a unique $y \\in B$ such that $x\\ f\\ y$, or equivalently $(x,y) \\in f$   Functions are also known as transformations, maps and mappings.   Examples:\nLet $A = \\{1,2,3\\} \\text{ and } B = \\{a,b\\}$\n$R = \\{(1,a), (2,a), (3,b)\\}$ is a function from $A$ to $B$. Let $A = \\{1,2,3\\} \\text{ and } B = \\{a,b\\}$\n$S = \\{(1,a), (1,b), (2,a), (3,b)\\}$ is not a function from $A$ to $B$. Let $A = \\{1,2,3\\} \\text{ and } B = \\{a,b\\}$\n$T = \\{(1,a), (3,b)\\}$ is not a function from $A$ to $B$. Function Notation  Let $f$ be a relation from $A$ to $B$. That is, $f \\subseteq A \\times B$ If the relation is a function:  We write $f: A \\to B$ If $(x,y) \\in f$, we write $y = f(x)$   Usually $f,g,h,\u0026hellip;$ are used to denote relations that are functions.   Notational Convention Sometimes functions are given by stating the rule of transformation. For example, $f(x) = x + 1$. This should be taken to mean:\n$$f = \\{(x,f(x)) \\in A \\times B \\ | \\ x \\in A \\}$$\nWhere $A$ and $B$ are some understood sets.\nValues, Images, Inverse Images, Pre-Images Values, Images Let $f: A \\to B$\nLet $y = f(x)$ or $(x,y) \\in f$\nThe object $y$ is called:\n The image of $x$ under the functions $f$.

Inverse Images, Pre-Images Let $f: A \\to B \\text{ and } y \\in B$\nDefine $f^{-1}(y) = \\{x \\in A | f(x) = y\\}$\nThe set of $f^{-1}(y)$ is called the inverse image , or pre-image of $y$ under $f$.\nImages and Pre-Images of Subsets Let $f: A \\to B \\text{ and } X \\subseteq A \\text{ and } Y \\subseteq B$\nWe define:\n $f(X) = \\{f(x) \\in B \\ | \\ x \\in X\\}$ $f^{-1}(Y) = \\{x \\in A \\ | \\ f(x) \\in Y\\}$  Some Properties  Let $f: A \\to B \\text{ and } X \\subseteq A \\text{ and } Y \\subseteq B$ $f(A) \\subseteq$ B $f^{-1}(B) = A$ because every element of $A$ has an image in $B$.  Questions  Let $f: A \\to B \\text{ and } X \\subseteq A \\text{ and } Y \\subseteq B$   If there are $n$ elements in $X$, how many elements are there in $f(X)$? If there are $n$ elements in $Y$, how many elements are there in $f^{-1}(Y)$?   Answers ↕   The number of elements in $f(X)$ could be any integer between $1$ and $n$. The number of elements in $f^{-1}(Y)$ cannot be determined.     Codomains, Domains, Ranges Domains  Let $f: A \\to B$  The domain of function $f$ is the set $A$.  Codomains and Ranges  Let $f: A \\to B$  The codomain of function $f$ is the set $B$.\nThe range of function $f$ is the set of images of $f$. Clearly, the range of $f$ is $f(A)$.\n Example:\n Consider $\\exp: \\Bbb R \\to \\Bbb R$. That is, $\\exp(x) = e^x$. The domain and codomain are both $\\Bbb R$, but the range of $\\exp$ is $\\Bbb R_+$, the set of positive reals.  Sets of Images and Pre-Images Images and Pre-Images of Subsets  Let $f:A \\to B$. Let $X, X^\\prime \\subseteq A \\text{ and } Y, Y^\\prime \\subseteq B$. We shall call $f(X)$ the image of $X$ instead of the set of images of members $X$. Similarly, we shall simply call $f^{-1}(Y)$ the pre-image of $Y$. We have:  $f(f^{-1}(Y)) \\subseteq Y \\text{ and } X \\subseteq f^{-1}(f(X))$  It is possible to have strict inclusion when the range of $f$ is a proper subset of its codomain, we may take $Y = B$ to obtain $f(f^{-1}(B)) = f(A) \\subset B$   $f(X \\cup X^\\prime) = f(X) \\cup f(X^\\prime), \\ f(X \\cap X^\\prime) \\subseteq f(X) \\cap f(X^\\prime)$  $\\because X \\cup X^\\prime \\supseteq X, f(X \\cup X^\\prime) \\supseteq f(X)$ $\\text{Likewise we have } f(X \\cup X^\\prime) \\supseteq f(X^\\prime)$ $\\therefore f(X \\cup X^\\prime) \\supseteq f(X) \\cup f(X^\\prime)$ $\\text{To show that } f(X \\cup X^\\prime) \\subseteq f(X) \\cup f(X^\\prime), \\text{ let } y \\in f(X \\cup X^\\prime)$ $\\exists x \\in X \\cup X^\\prime \\text{ such that } f(x) = y$ $x \\in X \\implies y \\in f(X); \\text{ otherwise, } y \\in f(X^\\prime)$ $\\therefore y \\in f(X) \\cup f(X^\\prime)$ That is, $f(X \\cup X^\\prime) \\subseteq f(X) \\cup f(X^\\prime)$   $f^{-1}(Y \\cup Y^\\prime) = f^{-1}(Y) \\cup f^{-1}(Y^\\prime)$ $f^{-1}(Y \\cap Y^\\prime) = f^{-1}(Y) \\cap f^{-1}(Y^\\prime)$    Equality of Functions  Let $f:A \\to B \\text{ and } g: C \\to D$ We define function $f = $ function $g$ if and only if set $f = $ set $g$ Note that this forces $A = C$ but allows $B \\not = D$.

For every $x \\in A, \\ I_A$ relates $x$ to a unique element of $A$ that is itself. Consequently we have $I_A: A \\to A$ $I_A$ is also called the identity function on $A$ The inverse of $I_A$ is itself.  Permutations A permutation $f$ of $A$ is a one-to-one correspondence from $A \\to A$   Every permutation $f$ of $A$ has the inverse $f^{-1}$. Which is also a permutation of $A$.  Permutations as 1D Arrays Any permutation of $A = \\{1,2,\u0026hellip;,n\\}$ can be expressed as an array.\n$$ \\begin{matrix} f[1] \u0026amp; f[2] \u0026amp; \u0026hellip; \u0026amp; f[n] \\end{matrix} $$\nPermutations as 2D Arrays Let $A = {1,2,\u0026hellip;,n}$. If $n = lm$, then a permutation $f$ of $A$ can also be defined as a two dimensional array\n  \\[\\begin{matrix} f[1] \u0026amp; f[2] \u0026amp; \\cdots \u0026amp; f[l] \\\\ f[1\u0026#43;l] \u0026amp; f[2\u0026#43;l] \u0026amp; \\cdots \u0026amp; f[2l] \\\\ f[1\u0026#43;2l] \u0026amp; f[2\u0026#43;2l] \u0026amp; \\cdots \u0026amp; f[3l] \\\\ \\vdots \u0026amp; \\vdots \u0026amp; \\ddots \u0026amp; \\vdots \\\\ f[1\u0026#43;(m-1)l] \u0026amp; f[2\u0026#43;(m-1)l] \u0026amp; \\cdots \u0026amp; f[ml] \\end{matrix}\\]  Constant Functions  $\\text{Let } f: A \\to B$ $\\text{If } f(A) = \\{y\\} \\text{ for some } y \\in B \\text{, $f$ is called a constant function of value }y$  Characteristic Functions  Consider some universal set $\\Bbb U$ Let $A \\in \\Bbb U$ The function $\\mathcal X_A: \\Bbb U \\to \\{0,1\\}$ is defined by:  $\\mathcal X_A(x) = 1 \\text{ if } x \\in A$ $\\mathcal X_A(x) = 0 \\text{ if } x \\in A^c$ And is called the characteristic function of A    Unary and Binary Operations as Functions Unary Operations  A unary operation on a set $A$ acts on an element of $A$ and produces another element of $A$. A unary operation $\\text{uop}$ can be thought of as a function $f:A \\to A$ with $f(x) = \\text{uop}(x)$. Conversely, a function from $A \\to A$ can be regarded as a unary operation on $A$.   Binary Operations  A binary operation on a set $A$ acts on two elements of $A$ and produces another element of $A$. Binary operation $\\text{bop}$ can be represented as a function  $f: A \\times A \\to A \\text{ with } f((a,b)) = a \\text{ bop } b$   We write $f(a,b)$ instead of $f((a,b))$ Conversely, from $A \\times A \\to A$ can be regarded as a binary operation on $A$   The Composition of Two Functions is a Function  Let $f: A \\to B \\text{ and } g:B \\to C$ Relations can be composed. Because functions are also relations, then functions can also be composed. So relations $f$ and $g$ can be composed, and their composition is $g \\circ f$ $g \\circ f$ is a relation from $A \\to C$  Funtion Composition gives a Function  Let $f: A \\to B \\text{ and } g:B \\to C$ We want to show that $g \\circ f : A \\to C$. That is, the composition of two functions is a function. We have to show that for any $x \\in A$, there is a unique $z \\in C$ such that $(x,z) \\in g \\circ f$  Existency Proof  $\\text{Let } x \\in A$ $\\text{Since $f$ is a function from $A \\to B$, there is a unique $y \\in B$ such that $(x,y) \\in f$}$ $\\text{For this $y \\in B$, there is a unique $z \\in C$ such that $(y,z) \\in g$}$ $\\text{ because $g$ is a function from } B \\to C$ $\\text{That is, $(x,z) \\in g \\circ f$}$  Uniqueness Proof  $\\text{Let } (x,z), (x,z^\\prime) \\in g \\circ f$ $\\text{There exist } y, y^\\prime \\in B \\text{ such that }$  $(x,y) \\in f, \\ (y,z) \\in g$ $(x, y^\\prime) \\in f, \\ (y^\\prime , z^\\prime) \\in g$   $\\text{But $f$ is a function, so } y = y^\\prime$ $\\text{Now we have } (y,z), (y, z^\\prime) \\in g$ $\\text{But $g$ is a function, so }z = z^\\prime$  The Values of Function Composition For Compositions of Two Functions  $\\text{Let } f: A \\to B \\text{ and } g: B \\to C$ $\\text{Since } g \\circ f: A \\to C \\text{, for any $x \\in A$, there is a } z \\in C, \\text{ such that } g \\circ f(x) = z$ $\\text{That is, } (x,z) \\in g \\circ f$ $\\text{By the definition of function composition, there is a } y \\in B \\text{, such that } (x,y) \\in f \\text{ and } (y,z) \\in g$. $\\text{Since $f$ and $g$ are functions, we can write } f(x) = y \\text{ and } g(y) = z$ $\\text{Substituting } y = f(x) \\text{ in } g(y) = z \\text{, we have } g(f(x)) = z$ $\\text{That is, } g \\circ f(x) = g(f(x))$  For Compositions of Three Functions  $\\text{Let } f: A \\to B, \\ g: B \\to C, \\ h: C \\to D$ $\\text{Since relation composition are associative and functions are relations, } h \\circ (g \\circ f) = (h \\circ g) \\circ f$ Furthermore we have:  $(h \\circ (g \\circ f))(x) = h((g \\circ f)(x)) = h(g(f(x)))$ $((h \\circ g) \\circ f)(x) = (h \\circ g)(f(x)) = h(g(f(x)))$   $\\text{That is, } (h \\circ (g \\circ f))(x) = ((h \\circ g) \\circ f)(x) = h(g(f(x)))$  One-To-One Functions, Injections  Let $f: A \\to B$ The function $f$ is only one-to-one if and only if:  for any $x,x^\\prime \\in A$ $f(x) = f(x^\\prime) \\implies x = x^\\prime$ Equivalently, $x \\not = x^\\prime \\implies f(x) \\not = f(x^\\prime)$   In words, a function is one-to-one if and only if it maps distinct elements to distinct images. A one-to-one functions is also called an injection We abbreviate one-to-one as 1-1.   Example:\n $\\text{Let }f:\\Bbb Z \\to \\Bbb Z \\text{ with } f(x) = x^2$ $f \\text{ is not 1-1 because }f(x) = f(-x)$  Composition of One-To-One Functions Theorem  $\\text{Let }f:A \\to B, \\ g:B \\to C$ $\\text{If both $f$ and $g$ are 1-1 then } g \\circ f \\text{ is also 1-1.}$ That is, the composition of 1-1 functions is 1-1.   Proof:\n $\\text{Let } (g \\circ f)(x) = (g \\circ f)(y)$ $g(f(x)) = g(f(y))$ $\\text{Since $g$ is 1-1, } f(x) = f(y)$ $\\text{Since $f$ is 1-1, } x = y$ $\\text{That is, } g \\circ f \\text{ is a 1-1 function}$  The Converse is Almost True (Its Still False)  $\\text{Let }f:A \\to B, \\ g:B \\to C$ $\\text{Let } g \\circ f: A \\to C \\text{ be 1-1}$ Then $f$ is 1-1, but $g$ doesnt have to be 1-1  Proof:\n $\\text{Let }f(x) = f(y)$ $\\text{Then } g(f(x)) = g(f(y))$ $(g \\circ f)(x) = (g \\circ f)(y)$ $x = y$ That is, $f$ is 1-1  Onto Functions, Surjections  $\\text{Let } f:A \\to B$ $\\text{The function $f$ is onto if and only if}$  For any $y \\in B$ There exists some $x \\in A$ Such that $f(x) = y$   In words, A function is onto if and only if every element in the codomain has a non-empty pre-image. An onto function is also called a surjection.   Onto Means Range is Codomain Proof:\n Let $f: A \\to B$ be onto. Onto implies $B \\subseteq f(A)$ Let $y \\in B$ There exists $x \\in A$ such that $f(x) = y$ $y \\in f(A)$ That is, $B \\subseteq A$ But $f(A) \\subseteq B$ That is, $B = f(A)$  Example:\n Let $f: \\Bbb Z\\to \\Bbb Z$ with $f(x) = x^2$ $f$ is not onto because there is no integer $x$ such that $f(x) = -1$  Composition of Surjections Theorem  $\\text{Let }f:A \\to B, \\ g:B \\to C$ $\\text{If both $f$ and $g$ are onto then } g \\circ f \\text{ is also onto.}$ That is, the composition of onto functions is onto.   Proof:\n $\\text{Let } z \\in C$ $\\text{Since } g: B \\to C \\text{ is onto, there is a } y \\in B \\text{ such that }g(y) = z$ $\\text{Since } f: A \\to B \\text{ is onto, there is an } x \\in A \\text{ such that }f(x) = y$ $\\text{Combining, we have }(g \\circ f)(x) = g(f(x)) = g(y) = z$ $\\text{That is, the composition }g \\circ f \\text{ is onto.}$  The Converse is Almost True (Its Still False.. Again..) Proof:\n $\\text{Let }f:A \\to B,\\ g:B \\to C$ $\\text{Let }g \\circ f:A \\to C \\text{ be onto.}$ $\\text{Then $g$ is onto, but $f$ need not be onto}$ $\\text{Since $g \\circ f$ is onto, for any $z \\in C$, there is an $x \\in A$ such that $(g \\circ f)(x) = z$}$ $\\text{That is, } g(f(x))=z$ $\\text{But }f(x) \\in B$ $\\text{So for any } z \\in C, \\text{ there is a } y = f(x) \\in B \\text{ such that } g(y) = x$ $\\text{That is, $g$ is onto.}$  1-1 and Onto Functions, Bijections, 1-1 Correspondences  Let $f:A \\to B$ The function $f$ is a 1-1 correspondence if and only if $f$ is 1-1 and onto. A 1-1 correspondence is also called a bijection.  Composition of Bijections Theorem  Let $f:A \\to B, \\ g:B \\to C$ If both $f$ and $g$ are both bijections, then $g \\circ f$ is also a bijection That is, the composition of bijections is a bijection.   Proof:\n Since $f$ and $g$ are 1-1, so is $g \\circ f$ Since $f$ and $g$ are onto, so is $g \\circ f$ Since $g \\circ f$ is 1-1 and onto, $g \\circ f$ is a bijection.  The Converse is Almost True (Its Still False.. Again.. Again..)  Since $g \\circ f$ is 1-1  $f$ is 1-1 $g$ may not be 1-1   Since $g \\circ f$ is onto  $g$ is onto $f$ may not be onto   That is, $f$ and $g$ need not be bijections.  Making an Injection a Bijection  Let $f:A \\to B$ be 1-1 Let $C = f(A)$ Then $f:A \\to C$ is a bijection  $f$ remains 1-1 $f$ has become onto    $f$ is a Bijection $\\implies f^{-1}$ is a Function  A function is invertible if and only if its inverse is also a function  Theorem  Let $f:A \\to B$. If $f$ is a bijection, then $f^{-1}$ is a function.   Proof:\n Let $f:A \\to B$ be a bijection. We want to show that $f^{-1} \\subseteq B \\times A$ is a function We need to show:  For any $y \\in B$, there is an $x \\in A$ such that $(y,x) \\in f^{-1}$ If $(y,x),(y,x^\\prime) \\in f^{-1}$, then $x=x^\\prime$    Proof for 1 (Every Member ofB Has an Image under $f^{-1}$):\n Let $y \\in B$ Since $f$ is onto, there is an $x \\in A$ such that $f(x) = y$ That is, for any $y \\in B$, there is an $x \\in A$, such that $(x,y) \\in f$ But $(x,y) \\in f \\implies (y,x) \\in f^{-1}$  Proof for 2 (The Image Under $f^{-1} is Unique$):\n Let $y \\in B$ Let $(y,x), (y,x^\\prime) \\in f^{-1}$ We have $(x,y), (x^\\prime, y) \\in f$ This gives $f(x) = y = f(x^\\prime)$ But $f$ is 1-1 gives $x = x^\\prime$  $f^{-1}$ is a Function $\\implies f$ is a Bijection Inverse Functions  Let $f:A \\to B$ Since $f$ is a function, it is a relation We know $f^{-1}$ is a relation from $B$ to $A$. If $f^{-1}$ is a function, then $f$ is 1-1 and onto.  Theorem  Let $f:A \\to B$ If $f^{-1}$ is a function, then $f$ is 1-1 and onto   Proof:\n Given $f^{-1}:B \\to A$ is a function We want to show $f:A \\to B$ is 1-1 and onto We need to show  $f(x) = f(x^\\prime) \\implies x \\ x^\\prime$ For any $y \\in B$, there is an $x \\in A$ such that $f(x) = y$    Proof $f$ is 1-1:\n Let $f(x) = f(x^\\prime) = y$ We have $(x,y),(x^\\prime ,y) \\in f$ $(y,x),(y,x^\\prime) \\in f^{-1}$ but $f^{-1}$ is a function, so the image of $y$ under it is unique, that is, $x=x^\\prime$ Since $x=x^\\prime$ whenever $f(x) = f(x^\\prime)$, $f$ is 1-1  Proof $f$ is onto:\n For any $y \\in B$, let $f^{-1}(y)=x$. That is, $(y,x) \\in f^{-1}$ $(x,y) \\in f$ and thus $f(x) = y$ Since any member of $B$ has a non-empty pre-image under $f$, $f$ is onto.  Properties of Inverse Functions The Inverse Image and the Pre-Image  Let $f:A \\to B$ and $f^{-1}:B \\to A$ We have $(x,y) \\in f$ if and only if $(y,x) \\in f^{-1}$ Since both $f$ and $f^{-1}$ are functions, the above can be written as $f(x) = y \\text{ iff }f^{-1}(y) = x$  Theorem If the inverse of a function is a function, the inverse function is a bijection  Proof:\n Let the functions $f$ and $f^{-1}$ be functions We have $(f^{-1})^{-1} = f$ is a function Since the inverse of $f^{-1}$ is a function, by a previous theorem, $f^{-1}$ is a bijection.  Function Composition Properties  Let $f:A \\to B$ be 1-1 and onto We have $f^{-1}:B \\to A$ is also 1-1 and onto We want to find:  $f \\circ f^{-1}$ $f^{-1} \\circ f$ $f \\circ I_A,\\ I_B \\circ f$ $I_A \\circ f^{-1},\\ f^{-1} \\circ I_B$    $f \\circ f^{-1}$  We have $f^{-1}: B \\to A, \\ f:A \\to B$ Let $(f \\circ f^{-1})(x) = y$  $f(f^{-1}(x)) = y$ $f^{-1}(x) = f^{-1}(y)$ But $f^{-1}$ is a bijection So $x = y$ And $f \\circ (f^{-1})(x) = x$   That is, $f \\circ f^{-1} = I_B$  $f^{-1} \\circ f$  We have $f:A \\to B, \\ f^{-1}:B \\to A$ Let $(f^-1 \\circ f)(x) = y$  $f^{-1}(f(x)) = y$ $f(x) = f(y)$ But $f$ is a bijection So $x = y$ And $f(^{-1} \\circ f)(x) = x$   That is, $f^{-1} \\circ f = I_A$  $f \\circ I_A$  We have $I_A:A \\to A, \\ f:A \\to B$ Let $(f\\circ I_A)(x) = y$  $f(I_A(x)) = y$ $f(x) = y$ $(f \\circ I_A)(x) = f(x)$   That is $f \\circ I_A = f$  $I_B \\circ f$  We have $f:A \\to B, \\ I_B:B \\to B$ Let $(I_B \\circ f)(x) = y$  $I_B(f(x)) = y$ $f(x) = y$ $(I_B \\circ f)(x) = f(x)$   That is $I_B \\circ f = f$  $I_A \\circ f^{-1}, \\ f^{-1} \\circ I_B$ Using a similar proof to the last two sections, we have:\n $I_A \\circ f^{-1} = f^{-1}$ $f^{-1} \\circ I_B = f^{-1}$  Questions Let $|A| = m$ and $|B| = n$.

Then there are two unique integers $q$ and $0 \\leq r \\leq |b|$ such that $a = qb+r$  Proof (Constructive):\n Define $\\mathcal E_b = 1$ if $b \u0026gt; 0$ and $\\mathcal E_b = -1$ if $b \u0026lt; 0$ Let $q = \\left \\lfloor \\frac{a}{b \\mathcal E_b} \\right \\rfloor$ and $r = a-q \\mathcal E_b b$ It can be checked that $0 \\leq r \\leq |b|$ and that $a = bq + r$ Proof of uniqueness of $q$ and $r$  Exercise    Definition $q$ and $r$ in the proof above are the quotient and remainder when $a$ is divided by $b$.\nWe write $r = a \\mod b$\nIf $a \\mod b = 0, \\ b$ is called a divisor or factor of $a$. In this case, we sat that $a$ is divisible by $b$ or $b$ divides $a$.\n Definition The greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers $a$ and $b$, denoted by $\\gcd (a,b)$, is the largest among all the common divisors of $a$ and $b$.  Proposition $\\gcd (b,a) = \\gcd (-b,a) = \\gcd (b,-a) = \\gcd (-b,-a) = \\gcd (a,b)$  Because of the proposition above we will only consider the case that $a \\geq 0$ and $b \\geq 0$ later on.\nProposition Let $a$ and $b$ be two integers such that $(a,b) \\not = (0,0)$. Then $\\gcd (b,a)$ must exist  Proof:\nThe total number of positive common divisors of $a$ and $b$ is at most $\\max (|a|,|b|)$\nThe Euclidean Algorithm Lemma Let $b \\not = 0$. Then $\\gcd (a,b) = \\gcd (b,\\ a\\mod b)$  Proof:\n Note that $a = qb + r$, where $r = a \\mod b$ is the remainder. By this equation, any common divisor of $a$ and $b$ must be a common divisor of $b$ and $r$. Hence the two sets of integers have the same GCD.

Brown, Computer Security: Principles and Practice, Pearson Education, 2008.   Physical Security  Physical security refers to the protection of building sites and equipment (and all information and software contained therein) from theft, vandalism, natural disaster, manmade catastrophes, and accidental damage (e.g., from electrical surges, extreme temperatures, and spilled coffee).  Elements of Physical Security  Obstacles, to frustrate trivial attacker and delay serious ones. (Prevention) Alarms, security lighting, guard patrols, closed-circuit cameras to make it likely that an attack will be noticed. (Detection) Security response, to repel, catch or frustrate attackers when an attack is detected. (Response)  In a well-designed system, these features must complement each other.\nDesign of Physical Security   Environmental Design (Prevention)\n The intial layer of security of a physical space. Used to deter threats Examples: warnings, fences, vehicle height restrictors, etc\u0026hellip;    Mechanical and Electronic Access Control (Prevention)\n Second layer of physical security Access control policy is what determines who grants access and how. Could be a guard controlled door, or a simple RFID card. Examples: Doors with locks, guard controlled doors or gates, etc\u0026hellip;    Intrusion detection (Detection)\n Third layer of physical security Monitors for attacks Less of a preventative measure, and more of a responsive measure.    Violating Physical Access Control  Masquerading: A person A person disguised as an authorized user. This can be done using a forged ID or pretending to be a repair man. Piggy-Backing: A person who enters the security perimeter by following an authorized user. Lock Picking: Any lock can be picked. Or better, go through dropped ceilings or removing the hinges from door. Visual/Auditory Access: Using side channels to get information which enable access.  Summary  Physical security helps:  Understand computer security Strengthen computer security    Physcial security is combined with information security in many real-world applications. Physical security is a vital part of any security plan and is fundamental to all security efforts. Without it, information security, software security, user access security and network security are considered more difficult, if not possible, to initiate.\n Source(s):\n  Course Notes (Lecture 1)  "});index.add({'id':6,'href':'/COMP4632/','title':"COMP4632 - Practicing Cybersecurity: Attacks and Counter-measures",'section':"Home",'content':"COMP4632 - Practicing Cybersecurity: Attacks and Counter-measures This course equips students with cybersecurity knowledge and current IT practices on security risk management.
