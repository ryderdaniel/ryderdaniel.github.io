Physical Security  Physical security refers to the protection of building sites and equipment (and all information and software contained therein) from theft, vandalism, natural disaster, manmade catastrophes, and accidental damage (e.g., from electrical surges, extreme temperatures, and spilled coffee).  Elements of Physical Security  Obstacles, to frustrate trivial attacker and delay serious ones. (Prevention) Alarms, security lighting, guard patrols, closed-circuit cameras to make it likely that an attack will be noticed. (Detection) Security response, to repel, catch or frustrate attackers when an attack is detected. (Response)  In a well-designed system, these features must complement each other.\nDesign of Physical Security   Environmental Design (Prevention)\n The intial layer of security of a physical space. Used to deter threats Examples: warnings, fences, vehicle height restrictors, etc\u0026hellip;    Mechanical and Electronic Access Control (Prevention)\n Second layer of physical security Access control policy is what determines who grants access and how. Could be a guard controlled door, or a simple RFID card. Examples: Doors with locks, guard controlled doors or gates, etc\u0026hellip;    Intrusion detection (Detection)\n Third layer of physical security Monitors for attacks Less of a preventative measure, and more of a responsive measure.    Violating Physical Access Control  Masquerading: A person A person disguised as an authorized user. This can be done using a forged ID or pretending to be a repair man. Piggy-Backing: A person who enters the security perimeter by following an authorized user. Lock Picking: Any lock can be picked. Or better, go through dropped ceilings or removing the hinges from door. Visual/Auditory Access: Using side channels to get information which enable access.  Summary  Physical security helps:  Understand computer security Strengthen computer security    Physcial security is combined with information security in many real-world applications. Physical security is a vital part of any security plan and is fundamental to all security efforts. Without it, information security, software security, user access security and network security are considered more difficult, if not possible, to initiate.\n Source(s):\n  Course Notes (Lecture 1)  "});index.add({'id':2,'href':'/about/','title':"About",'section':"Spring 2021",'content':"Some big markdown smaller\u0026hellip; "});})();
