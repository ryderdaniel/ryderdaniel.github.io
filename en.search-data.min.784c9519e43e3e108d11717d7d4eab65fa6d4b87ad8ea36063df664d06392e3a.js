Members and Elements  The objects that make up a set are called members or elements of the set. An object is anything that is \u0026ldquo;meaningful\u0026rdquo;. For example: a number, equation, other sets, etc\u0026hellip;  Equality of Sets  Two sets are equal if an only if they have the same members. That is, a set is completely determined by its members. This is the principle of extension.  Set Notation A set can be described by listing comma seperated members within curly braces\nExample:\nLet $S = \\{1,3,9\\}$\n$S$ is a set, and $1,3,9$ are its members.\n It is important to note that order and repetition do not matter in sets. That is, $\\{1,3,9\\}$ is equivalent to $\\{9,1,3\\}$ and $\\{1,1,1,1,9,9,9,9,3,9,3\\}$. They all denote a set whose members are $1, 3, \\text{and} \\space 9$.\nThe Membership Symbol $\\in$  The fact that $x$ is a member of $S$ can be expressed as $x \\in S$. The membership symbol $\\in$ can be read as \u0026ldquo;is in\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;is a member of\u0026rdquo;, or \u0026ldquo;belongs to\u0026rdquo;. The negation of $\\in$ is $\\not\\in$  Example:\nLet $S = \\{7,13,21,47\\}$, then $7 \\in S, 13 \\in S, 21 \\in S, 47 \\in S, 56 \\not\\in S$.\nDefining a Set by Membership Properties $$S = \\{x \\in T \\space| \\space P(x)\\}$$ The members of $S$ are members of an already known set $T$ that satisfy property $P$.  Example:\n Let $\\Bbb Z$ be the set of integers. Let $\\Bbb Z_+$ be the set of positive integers. Then $\\Bbb Z_+ = \\{x \\in \\Bbb Z \\space | \\space x \u0026gt; 0\\}$  The Empty Set and Sets of Numbers The Empty Set  The empty set is also called the null set. It is a set with no members. It is denoted as $\\emptyset$. Thus $\\{\\} = \\emptyset$ For any object $x, x\\not\\in \\emptyset$.  The Sets of Positive, Negative, and All Integers  $\\Bbb Z$ is the set of all integers.  $\\Bbb Z = \\{\u0026hellip;, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, \u0026hellip;\\}$   $\\Bbb Z_+$ is the set of all positive integers.  $\\Bbb Z_+ = \\{1,2,3,\u0026hellip;\\} = \\{x\\in \\Bbb Z \\space | \\space x \u0026gt; 0\\}$   $\\Bbb Z_-$ is the set of all positive integers.  $\\Bbb Z_- = \\{\\space\u0026hellip;,-3,-2,-1\\} = \\{x\\in \\Bbb Z \\space | \\space x \u0026lt; 0\\}$    The set of Real Numbers and Rational Numbers  $\\Bbb R$ is the set of all real numbers. $\\Bbb Q$ is the set of all rational numbers. $\\Bbb Q = \\{x \\in \\Bbb R \\space | \\space x = p/q; \\space p,q \\in \\Bbb Z; \\space q \\not = 0\\}$  Subsets and Power Sets Subsets ($\\subset, \\subseteq$) $A$ is a subset of $B$, or $B$ is a superset of $A$ if and only if every member of $A$ is a member of $B$  Notation:\n$$A \\subseteq B \\text{ iff } \\space \\forall x, x \\in A \\implies x \\in B$$\nExample:\n$$\\{-2,0,8\\} \\subseteq \\{-3,-2,-1,0,2,4,6,8,10\\}$$\nNegation of $\\subseteq$ $A$ is not a subset of $B$, or $B$ is not a superset of $A$ if and only if there is a member of $A$ that is not a member of $B$  Notation:\n$$A \\not \\subseteq \\text{ iff } \\space \\exists x, x \\in A \\text{ and } x \\not \\in B$$\nExample:\n$$\\{2,4\\} = \\{2,3\\}$$\nObvious Subsets  $S \\subseteq S$ $\\emptyset \\subseteq S$  Vacuously true: $\\text{if } x \\in \\emptyset \\implies x \\in S$ By contradiction: $\\text{if } \\emptyset \\not \\subseteq S \\implies \\exists x, x \\in \\emptyset \\text{ and } x \\not \\in S$    Proper Subsets "});index.add({'id':2,'href':'/COMP4631/01.-Introduction-and-Physical-Security/','title':"Course Introduction and Physical Security",'section':"COMP4631 - Computer and Communication Security",'content':"Course Introduction and Physical Security Topics to be Covered  Computer Security: An Introduction Conventional Cryptosystems Public-Key Cryptosystems Key Management Hash Functions, Authentication Digital Signature, Identification Access Control Unix Security Windows NT Security Distributed System Security Network Security IP Security Email Security Web Security Firewalls Virtual Private Networks  Reference Books  Behrouz A.

Brown, Computer Security: Principles and Practice, Pearson Education, 2008.   Physical Security  Physical security refers to the protection of building sites and equipment (and all information and software contained therein) from theft, vandalism, natural disaster, manmade catastrophes, and accidental damage (e.g., from electrical surges, extreme temperatures, and spilled coffee).  Elements of Physical Security  Obstacles, to frustrate trivial attacker and delay serious ones. (Prevention) Alarms, security lighting, guard patrols, closed-circuit cameras to make it likely that an attack will be noticed. (Detection) Security response, to repel, catch or frustrate attackers when an attack is detected. (Response)  In a well-designed system, these features must complement each other.\nDesign of Physical Security   Environmental Design (Prevention)\n The intial layer of security of a physical space. Used to deter threats Examples: warnings, fences, vehicle height restrictors, etc\u0026hellip;    Mechanical and Electronic Access Control (Prevention)\n Second layer of physical security Access control policy is what determines who grants access and how. Could be a guard controlled door, or a simple RFID card. Examples: Doors with locks, guard controlled doors or gates, etc\u0026hellip;    Intrusion detection (Detection)\n Third layer of physical security Monitors for attacks Less of a preventative measure, and more of a responsive measure.    Violating Physical Access Control  Masquerading: A person A person disguised as an authorized user. This can be done using a forged ID or pretending to be a repair man. Piggy-Backing: A person who enters the security perimeter by following an authorized user. Lock Picking: Any lock can be picked. Or better, go through dropped ceilings or removing the hinges from door. Visual/Auditory Access: Using side channels to get information which enable access.  Summary  Physical security helps:  Understand computer security Strengthen computer security    Physcial security is combined with information security in many real-world applications. Physical security is a vital part of any security plan and is fundamental to all security efforts. Without it, information security, software security, user access security and network security are considered more difficult, if not possible, to initiate.\n Source(s):\n  Course Notes (Lecture 1)  "});index.add({'id':3,'href':'/COMP4632/','title':"COMP4632 - Practicing Cybersecurity: Attacks and Counter-measures",'section':"Home",'content':"COMP4632 - Practicing Cybersecurity: Attacks and Counter-measures This course equips students with cybersecurity knowledge and current IT practices on security risk management.

Contest-type “attack and defend” programming problems (also known as Capture-The-Flag, CTF, problems) will be employed throughout this course to practically train the students for the cybersecurity contests. The topics covered will include but not limited to binary analysis, cryptography, web exploitations, and packet capture analysis. These topics will be covered in the practical attack-and-defend context. Recent developments in the topics will also be investigated by students via CTF problem solving.
