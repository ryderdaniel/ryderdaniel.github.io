Members and Elements  The objects that make up a set are called members or elements of the set. An object is anything that is \u0026ldquo;meaningful\u0026rdquo;. For example: a number, equation, other sets, etc\u0026hellip;  Equality of Sets  Two sets are equal if and only if they have the same members. That is, a set is completely determined by its members. This is the principle of extension.  Set Notation A set can be described by listing comma seperated members within curly braces\nExample:\nLet $S = \\{1,3,9\\}$\n$S$ is a set, and $1,3,9$ are its members.\n It is important to note that order and repetition do not matter in sets. That is, $\\{1,3,9\\}$ is equivalent to $\\{9,1,3\\}$ and $\\{1,1,1,1,9,9,9,9,3,9,3\\}$. They all denote a set whose members are $1, 3, \\text{and} \\space 9$.\nThe Membership Symbol $\\in$  The fact that $x$ is a member of $S$ can be expressed as $x \\in S$. The membership symbol $\\in$ can be read as \u0026ldquo;is in\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;is a member of\u0026rdquo;, or \u0026ldquo;belongs to\u0026rdquo;. The negation of $\\in$ is $\\not\\in$  Example:\nLet $S = \\{7,13,21,47\\}$, then $7 \\in S, 13 \\in S, 21 \\in S, 47 \\in S, 56 \\not\\in S$.\nDefining a Set by Membership Properties $$S = \\{x \\in T \\space| \\space P(x)\\}$$ The members of $S$ are members of an already known set $T$ that satisfy property $P$.  Example:\n Let $\\Bbb Z$ be the set of integers. Let $\\Bbb Z_+$ be the set of positive integers. Then $\\Bbb Z_+ = \\{x \\in \\Bbb Z \\space | \\space x \u0026gt; 0\\}$  The Empty Set and Sets of Numbers The Empty Set  The empty set is also called the null set. It is a set with no members. It is denoted as $\\emptyset$. Thus $\\{\\} = \\emptyset$ For any object $x, x\\not\\in \\emptyset$.  The Sets of Positive, Negative, and All Integers  $\\Bbb Z$ is the set of all integers.  $\\Bbb Z = \\{\u0026hellip;, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, \u0026hellip;\\}$   $\\Bbb Z_+$ is the set of all positive integers.  $\\Bbb Z_+ = \\{1,2,3,\u0026hellip;\\} = \\{x\\in \\Bbb Z \\space | \\space x \u0026gt; 0\\}$   $\\Bbb Z_-$ is the set of all positive integers.  $\\Bbb Z_- = \\{\\space\u0026hellip;,-3,-2,-1\\} = \\{x\\in \\Bbb Z \\space | \\space x \u0026lt; 0\\}$    The set of Real Numbers and Rational Numbers  $\\Bbb R$ is the set of all real numbers. $\\Bbb Q$ is the set of all rational numbers. $\\Bbb Q = \\{x \\in \\Bbb R \\space | \\space x = p/q; \\space p,q \\in \\Bbb Z; \\space q \\not = 0\\}$  Subsets and Power Sets Subsets ($\\subset, \\subseteq$) $A$ is a subset of $B$, or $B$ is a superset of $A$ if and only if every member of $A$ is a member of $B$  Notation:\n$$A \\subseteq B \\text{ iff } \\space \\forall x, x \\in A \\implies x \\in B$$\nExample:\n$$\\{-2,0,8\\} \\subseteq \\{-3,-2,-1,0,2,4,6,8,10\\}$$\nNegation of $\\subseteq$ $A$ is not a subset of $B$, or $B$ is not a superset of $A$ if and only if there is a member of $A$ that is not a member of $B$  Notation:\n$$A \\not \\subseteq \\text{ iff } \\space \\exists x, x \\in A \\text{ and } x \\not \\in B$$\nExample:\n$$\\{2,4\\} \\not \\subseteq \\{2,3\\}$$\nObvious Subsets  $S \\subseteq S$ $\\emptyset \\subseteq S$  Vacuously true: $\\text{if } x \\in \\emptyset \\implies x \\in S$ By contradiction: $\\text{if } \\emptyset \\not \\subseteq S \\implies \\exists x, x \\in \\emptyset \\text{ and } x \\not \\in S$    Proper Subsets $\\subset$ $A$ is a proper subset of $B$, or $B$ is a proper superset of $A$ if and only if $A$ is a subset of $B$ and $A$ is not equal to $B$.  Notation:\n$$A \\subset B \\text{ iff } A \\subseteq B \\text{ and } A \\not = B$$\nExamples:\n$$S \\not = \\emptyset \\implies \\emptyset \\subset S$$\n$$\\Bbb Z_+ \\subset \\Bbb Z \\subset \\Bbb Q \\subset \\Bbb R$$\nPower Sets The set of all subsets of a set is called the power set of the set.\nThe power set of $S$ is $P(S)$\n Examples:\n $P(\\emptyset) = \\{\\emptyset\\}$ $P(\\{1,2\\}) = \\{\\emptyset, \\{1\\}, \\{2\\}, \\{1,2\\}\\}$ $P(S) = \\{\\emptyset, \u0026hellip;, S\\}$  $\\in$ and $\\subseteq$ are different!\nExamples:\n $1 \\in \\{1\\}$ is true. $1 \\subseteq \\{1\\}$ is false. $\\{1\\} \\subseteq \\{1\\}$ is true.   Questions  Which of the following statements is true?  $S \\subseteq P(S)$ $S \\in P(S)$   What is $P(\\{1,2,3\\})$?   Answers ↕   $S \\in P(S)$ $P(\\{1,2,3\\}) = \\{\\emptyset, \\{1\\}, \\{2\\}, \\{3\\}, \\{1,2\\}, \\{1,3\\}, \\{2,3\\}, \\{1,2,3\\}\\}$     Equality of Sets by Mutual Inclusion Sets $A$ and $B$ have the same members if and only if they mutually include. Meaning, $A \\subseteq B \\text{ and } B \\subseteq A$.\nThat is, $A = B \\text{ iff } A \\subseteq B \\text{ and } B \\subseteq A$\n Mutual inclusion is very useful for proving the equality of two sets. To prove and equality, we prove two subset relationships.\nExample Showing the Equality of Sets:\n Recall that $\\Bbb Z$ is the set of all integers. Let $A = \\{x \\in \\Bbb Z \\space | \\space x = 2m \\space \\text{for some } m \\in \\Bbb Z \\}$ Let $B = \\{y \\in \\Bbb Z \\space | \\space y = 2n-2 \\space \\text{for some } n \\in \\Bbb Z\\}$ To show that $A \\subseteq B$, note that  $2m = 2(m+1)-2 = 2n-2$   To show that $B \\subseteq A$, note that  $2n-2 = 2(n-1) = 2m$   That is, $A=B$ Both $A$ and $B$ denote the set of even integers.  Exercise:\n Let  $A = \\{x \\in \\Bbb Z \\space | \\space x^2 -1 = 0\\}$ $B = \\{x \\in \\Bbb Z \\space | \\space 2x^3 - x^2 -2x +1 = 0\\}$    Show that $A = B$ by the method of mutual inclusion.\n Potential Answer ↕   To show that $A \\subseteq B$:  $x^2 -1 = 0 \\implies x = \\pm 1$ $\\because x = \\pm 1, \\space x^3 = x$ $\\forall n \\in \\Bbb R, \\space n - n = 0$ $\\text{From (2) and (3), } \\space x^2-1=0 \\implies -(x^2-1) + (2x^3-2x) = 0$ $\\therefore x^2-1 = 0 \\implies 2x^3-x^2-2x+1=0$   To show that $B \\subseteq A$:  $2x^3-x^2-2x+1=0$ $2x(x^2-1)-(x^2-1)=0$ $(2x-1)(x^2-1)=0$ $\\because x \\in \\Bbb Z, \\space (2x-1)(x^2-1) = 0 \\implies (x^2-1) = 0$    $\\therefore A = B$    Universal Sets, Venn Diagrams Universal Sets  Depending on the context of discussion:  Define a set $U$ such that all sets of interest are subsets of $\\Bbb U$. The set $\\Bbb U$ is known as a universal set.     Example:\n When dealing with integers, $\\Bbb U$ may be $\\Bbb Z$. When dealing with plane geometry, $\\Bbb U$ may be the set of all points in the plane.  Venn Diagrams  Used to visualize relationships among some sets Each subset of $\\Bbb U$ is represented by a circle/oval inside of a rectangle.   Set Operations Let $A, B$ be subsets of some universal set $\\Bbb U$.\nThe following set operations create new sets from $A$ and $B$:\n Union  $A \\cup B = \\{x \\in \\Bbb U \\space | \\space x \\in A \\text{ or } x \\in B\\}$ Example: $$\\{1,2,3\\} \\cup \\{2,3,4,5\\} = \\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$$   Intersection  $A \\cap B = \\{x \\in \\Bbb U \\space | \\space x \\in A \\text{ and } x \\in B\\}$ Example: $$\\{1,2,3\\} \\cap \\{2,3,4,5\\} = \\{2,3\\}$$   Difference  $A - B = A \\backslash B = \\{x \\in \\Bbb U \\space | \\space x \\in A \\text{ and } x \\not \\in B\\}$ Example: $$\\{1,2,3\\} - \\{2,3,4,5\\} = \\{1\\}$$   Complement  $A^c = \\Bbb U - A = \\{x \\in \\Bbb U \\space | \\space x \\not \\in A\\}$    Venn Diagram Visualization Union  Intersection  Difference  Complement   Set Identities  Commutative Laws:  $A \\cup B = B \\cup A$ $A \\cap B = B \\cap A$   Associative Laws:  $(A \\cup B) \\cup C = A \\cup (B \\cup C)$ $(A \\cap B) \\cap C = A \\cap (B \\cap C)$   Distributive Laws:  $A \\cup (B \\cap C) = (A \\cup B) \\cap (A \\cup C)$ $A \\cap (B \\cup C) = (A \\cap B) \\cup (A \\cap C)$   $\\emptyset$ is the identity for union:  $\\emptyset \\cup A = A \\cup \\emptyset = A$   $\\Bbb U$ is the identitiy for intersection:  $A \\cap \\Bbb U = \\Bbb U \\cap A = A$   Double Complement Law:  $(A^c)^c = A$   Idempotent Laws:  $A \\cup A = A$ $A \\cap A = A$   De Morgan\u0026rsquo;s Laws:  $(A \\cup B)^c = A^c \\cap B^c$ $(A \\cap B)^c = A^c \\cup B^c$    Questions  What is $(A \\cap B) \\cap (A \\cup B)$?

Effectively associating or relating one value to another.\nGeneral Functions Since a function relates one value to another, we can think of a function as relating one object to another object. These objects dont necessarily need to be numbers.\nUsually, we want to be able to relate each object of interest to only one object. That is, a function is a single-valued and exhaustive relation.\n A relation $f$ from $A$ to $B$ is a function from $A$ to $B$ if and only if:  For every $x \\in A$, there exists a unique $y \\in B$ such that $x\\ f\\ y$, or equivalently $(x,y) \\in f$   Functions are also known as transformations, maps and mappings.   Examples:\nLet $A = \\{1,2,3\\} \\text{ and } B = \\{a,b\\}$\n$R = \\{(1,a), (2,a), (3,b)\\}$ is a function from $A$ to $B$. Let $A = \\{1,2,3\\} \\text{ and } B = \\{a,b\\}$\n$S = \\{(1,a), (1,b), (2,a), (3,b)\\}$ is not a function from $A$ to $B$. Let $A = \\{1,2,3\\} \\text{ and } B = \\{a,b\\}$\n$T = \\{(1,a), (3,b)\\}$ is not a function from $A$ to $B$. Function Notation  Let $f$ be a relation from $A$ to $B$. That is, $f \\subseteq A \\times B$ If the relation is a function:  We write $f: A \\to B$ If $(x,y) \\in f$, we write $y = f(x)$   Usually $f,g,h,\u0026hellip;$ are used to denote relations that are functions.   Notational Convention Sometimes functions are given by stating the rule of transformation. For example, $f(x) = x + 1$. This should be taken to mean:\n$$f = \\{(x,f(x)) \\in A \\times B \\ | \\ x \\in A \\}$$\nWhere $A$ and $B$ are some understood sets.\nValues, Images, Inverse Images, Pre-Images Values, Images Let $f: A \\to B$\nLet $y = f(x)$ or $(x,y) \\in f$\nThe object $y$ is called:\n The image of $x$ under the functions $f$. The value of $f$ at $x$.  Inverse Images, Pre-Images Let $f: A \\to B \\text{ and } y \\in B$\nDefine $f^{-1}(y) = \\{x \\in A | f(x) = y\\}$\nThe set of $f^{-1}(y)$ is called the inverse image , or pre-image of $y$ under $f$.\nImages and Pre-Images of Subsets Let $f: A \\to B \\text{ and } X \\subseteq A \\text{ and } Y \\subseteq B$\nWe define:\n $f(X) = \\{f(x) \\in B \\ | \\ x \\in X\\}$ $f^{-1}(Y) = \\{x \\in A \\ | \\ f(x) \\in Y\\}$  Some Properties  Let $f: A \\to B \\text{ and } X \\subseteq A \\text{ and } Y \\subseteq B$ $f(A) \\subseteq$ B $f^{-1}(B) = A$ because every element of $A$ has an image in $B$.  Questions  Let $f: A \\to B \\text{ and } X \\subseteq A \\text{ and } Y \\subseteq B$   If there are $n$ elements in $X$, how many elements are there in $f(X)$? If there are $n$ elements in $Y$, how many elements are there in $f^{-1}(Y)$?   Answers ↕   The number of elements in $f(X)$ could be any integer between $1$ and $n$. The number of elements in $f^{-1}(Y)$ cannot be determined.     Codomains, Domains, Ranges Domains  Let $f: A \\to B$  The domain of function $f$ is the set $A$.  Codomains and Ranges  Let $f: A \\to B$  The codomain of function $f$ is the set $B$.\nThe range of function $f$ is the set of images of $f$. Clearly, the range of $f$ is $f(A)$.\n Example:\n Consider $\\exp: \\Bbb R \\to \\Bbb R$. That is, $\\exp(x) = e^x$. The domain and codomain are both $\\Bbb R$, but the range of $\\exp$ is $\\Bbb R_+$, the set of positive reals.  Sets of Images and Pre-Images Images and Pre-Images of Subsets  Let $f:A \\to B$. Let $X, X^\\prime \\subseteq A \\text{ and } Y, Y^\\prime \\subseteq B$. We shall call $f(X)$ the image of $X$ instead of the set of images of members $X$. Similarly, we shall simply call $f^{-1}(Y)$ the pre-image of $Y$. We have:  $f(f^{-1}(Y)) \\subseteq Y \\text{ and } X \\subseteq f^{-1}(f(X))$  It is possible to have strict inclusion when the range of $f$ is a proper subset of its codomain, we may take $Y = B$ to obtain $f(f^{-1}(B)) = f(A) \\subset B$   $f(X \\cup X^\\prime) = f(X) \\cup f(X^\\prime), \\ f(X \\cap X^\\prime) \\subseteq f(X) \\cap f(X^\\prime)$  $\\because X \\cup X^\\prime \\supseteq X, f(X \\cup X^\\prime) \\supseteq f(X)$ $\\text{Likewise we have } f(X \\cup X^\\prime) \\supseteq f(X^\\prime)$ $\\therefore f(X \\cup X^\\prime) \\supseteq f(X) \\cup f(X^\\prime)$ $\\text{To show that } f(X \\cup X^\\prime) \\subseteq f(X) \\cup f(X^\\prime), \\text{ let } y \\in f(X \\cup X^\\prime)$ $\\exists x \\in X \\cup X^\\prime \\text{ such that } f(x) = y$ $x \\in X \\implies y \\in f(X); \\text{ otherwise, } y \\in f(X^\\prime)$ $\\therefore y \\in f(X) \\cup f(X^\\prime)$ That is, $f(X \\cup X^\\prime) \\subseteq f(X) \\cup f(X^\\prime)$   $f^{-1}(Y \\cup Y^\\prime) = f^{-1}(Y) \\cup f^{-1}(Y^\\prime)$ $f^{-1}(Y \\cap Y^\\prime) = f^{-1}(Y) \\cap f^{-1}(Y^\\prime)$    Equality of Functions  Let $f:A \\to B \\text{ and } g: C \\to D$ We define function $f = $ function $g$ if and only if set $f = $ set $g$ Note that this forces $A = C$ but allows $B \\not = D$. Some still require $B = D$.   Proof that Set $f = $ Set $g \\implies $ Domain $f = $ Domain $g$ "});index.add({'id':2,'href':'/COMP4631/01.-Introduction-and-Physical-Security/','title':"Course Introduction and Physical Security",'section':"COMP4631 - Computer and Communication Security",'content':"Course Introduction and Physical Security Topics to be Covered  Computer Security: An Introduction Conventional Cryptosystems Public-Key Cryptosystems Key Management Hash Functions, Authentication Digital Signature, Identification Access Control Unix Security Windows NT Security Distributed System Security Network Security IP Security Email Security Web Security Firewalls Virtual Private Networks  Reference Books  Behrouz A.

Brown, Computer Security: Principles and Practice, Pearson Education, 2008.   Physical Security  Physical security refers to the protection of building sites and equipment (and all information and software contained therein) from theft, vandalism, natural disaster, manmade catastrophes, and accidental damage (e.g., from electrical surges, extreme temperatures, and spilled coffee).  Elements of Physical Security  Obstacles, to frustrate trivial attacker and delay serious ones. (Prevention) Alarms, security lighting, guard patrols, closed-circuit cameras to make it likely that an attack will be noticed. (Detection) Security response, to repel, catch or frustrate attackers when an attack is detected. (Response)  In a well-designed system, these features must complement each other.\nDesign of Physical Security   Environmental Design (Prevention)\n The intial layer of security of a physical space. Used to deter threats Examples: warnings, fences, vehicle height restrictors, etc\u0026hellip;    Mechanical and Electronic Access Control (Prevention)\n Second layer of physical security Access control policy is what determines who grants access and how. Could be a guard controlled door, or a simple RFID card. Examples: Doors with locks, guard controlled doors or gates, etc\u0026hellip;    Intrusion detection (Detection)\n Third layer of physical security Monitors for attacks Less of a preventative measure, and more of a responsive measure.    Violating Physical Access Control  Masquerading: A person A person disguised as an authorized user. This can be done using a forged ID or pretending to be a repair man. Piggy-Backing: A person who enters the security perimeter by following an authorized user. Lock Picking: Any lock can be picked. Or better, go through dropped ceilings or removing the hinges from door. Visual/Auditory Access: Using side channels to get information which enable access.  Summary  Physical security helps:  Understand computer security Strengthen computer security    Physcial security is combined with information security in many real-world applications. Physical security is a vital part of any security plan and is fundamental to all security efforts. Without it, information security, software security, user access security and network security are considered more difficult, if not possible, to initiate.\n Source(s):\n  Course Notes (Lecture 1)  "});index.add({'id':3,'href':'/COMP4632/','title':"COMP4632 - Practicing Cybersecurity: Attacks and Counter-measures",'section':"Home",'content':"COMP4632 - Practicing Cybersecurity: Attacks and Counter-measures This course equips students with cybersecurity knowledge and current IT practices on security risk management.
