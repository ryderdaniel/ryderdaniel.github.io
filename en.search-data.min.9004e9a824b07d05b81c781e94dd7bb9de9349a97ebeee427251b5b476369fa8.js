Physical Security  Physical security refers to the protection of building sites and equipment (and all information and software contained therein) from theft, vandalism, natural disaster, manmade catastrophes, and accidental damage (e.g., from electrical surges, extreme temperatures, and spilled coffee).  Elements of Physical Security  Obstacles, to frustrate trivial attacker and delay serious ones. (Prevention) Alarms, security lighting, guard patrols, closed-circuit cameras to make it likely that an attack will be noticed. (Detection) Security response, to repel, catch or frustrate attackers when an attack is detected. (Response)  In a well-designed system, these features must complement each other.\nDesign of Physical Security   Environmental Design (Prevention)\n The intial layer of security of a physical space. Used to deter threats Examples: warnings, fences, vehicle height restrictors, etc\u0026hellip;    Mechanical and Electronic Access Control (Prevention)\n Second layer of physical security Access control policy is what determines who grants access and how. Could be a guard controlled door, or a simple RFID card. Examples: Doors with locks, guard controlled doors or gates, etc\u0026hellip;    Intrusion detection (Detection)\n Third layer of physical security Monitors for attacks Less of a preventative measure, and more of a responsive measure.    Violating Physical Access Control  Masquerading: A person A person disguised as an authorized user. This can be done using a forged ID or pretending to be a repair man. Piggy-Backing: A person who enters the security perimeter by following an authorized user. Lock Picking: Any lock can be picked. Or better, go through dropped ceilings or removing the hinges from door. Visual/Auditory Access: Using side channels to get information which enable access.  Summary  Physical security helps:  Understand computer security Strengthen computer security    Physcial security is combined with information security in many real-world applications. Physical security is a vital part of any security plan and is fundamental to all security efforts. Without it, information security, software security, user access security and network security are considered more difficult, if not possible, to initiate.\n Source(s):\n  Course Notes (Lecture 1)  "});index.add({'id':2,'href':'/COMP4632/','title':"COMP4632 - Practicing Cybersecurity: Attacks and Counter-measures",'section':"Home",'content':"COMP4632 - Practicing Cybersecurity: Attacks and Counter-measures This course equips students with cybersecurity knowledge and current IT practices on security risk management. Through hands-on laboratory sessions, students will understand existing IT security issues, learn how to assess IT security risks, and conduct experiments on ethical hacking. They will practice system attack and defense strategies using security tools, so as to gain practical experience to become a cybersecurity professional. The course covers current security trends, industrial practices on IT security, design requirements for secure web and mobile applications, security assessment, risk analysis and risk management.

Students who have passed COMP4901N and have gotten the instructor consent can join COMP4901O in a subsequent Spring semester, they will be working together based on the knowledge they have learned from COMP4901O, forming teams to further investigate various advanced topics related to the more practical side of cybersecurity. They will then join the various cybersecurity contests. The students will get 1 credit for successfully completing COMP4901O. Contest-type “attack and defend” programming problems (also known as Capture-The-Flag, CTF, problems) will be employed throughout this course to practically train the students for the cybersecurity contests. The topics covered will include but not limited to binary analysis, cryptography, web exploitations, and packet capture analysis. These topics will be covered in the practical attack-and-defend context. Recent developments in the topics will also be investigated by students via CTF problem solving.

Through hands on work with a simple but fully functional wireless communication system, you will understand the basic engineering tools used and tradeoffs encountered in the design of these systems. This course is centered on weekly laboratories, each designed to introduce an important concept in the design of these systems. The lab sessions are supported by two one-hour lectures and a tutorial that introduce the concepts for the next laboratory, as well as reviewing and expanding the concepts learned in the previous laboratory.\n  "});})();
